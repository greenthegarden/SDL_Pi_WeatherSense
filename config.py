# configuration for WeatherRack2
# This variables tell you how often to record values for the WeahterRack2
# You get a reading about every 45 seconds and this leads to big databases 
# about 14,000 records a week.  Remember that each FT020 Transmission is
# duplicated which means you nead a value of 2X what you want
# The default value is 20, which gives us about 1400 or about every 7.5 minutes.

# This variable controls how often to record the indoor T/H sensors
# You may have a total of 8 sensors and they each transmit around 60 seconds
# this will cause a possible total number of records per week of: 80,640 records
# The indoor T/H sensors also send a duplicate record but the rtl_433 software
# filters it out.
# The default value is 10, which gives us a value about every 10 minutes 
# per sensor.  Each sensor is counted seperately in the wirelessSensors.py
